# React Quiz App

This is a simple quiz app built with React. It's designed to be a quick and fun way to test your knowledge of React concepts.

The app uses a JSON server to simulate a backend API. It retrieves questions and answers from a local JSON file.

The quiz consists of 15 questions. Each question has four options, only one of which is correct. The user can select an option and click the "Next" button to see if they are correct. If they are, they earn points.

The quiz has a timer. If the user runs out of time, they lose points. Each question takes 30 seconds to answer.

When the quiz is over, the user can see their score and the high score. If their score is higher than the high score, their score becomes the new high score.

Enjoy!
